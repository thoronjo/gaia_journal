# make something

build your first app with ai. no coding experience needed. seriously.

## what is this?

this is the starter repo for **make something** — a free, live tutorial where i show you how to build a real app using openai codex (an ai that writes code for you). you watch me build one from scratch, then you go build your own.

this repo is what you'll use to build yours. it comes with everything pre-configured — a framework, a component library, styling, animations — so you can focus on your idea instead of setup. an ai agent lives inside it that helps you build, answers questions, and handles the code.

you just need a laptop, a chatgpt account (free version works), and an idea. if you don't have an idea yet, no worries — the agent will help you think of one.

## who this is for

- complete beginners — zero coding knowledge needed
- people with ideas who don't know where to start
- anyone curious about building with ai but hasn't tried it yet

## quick setup

### mac

open Terminal and paste:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/filip-pilar/makesomething/main/scripts/setup-mac.sh)
```

### windows

open PowerShell and paste:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/filip-pilar/makesomething/main/scripts/setup-windows.ps1 | iex
```

## resume

already set up? open the **make-something** folder on your Desktop and double-click:

- **mac:** `run.command`
- **windows:** `run.bat`

## how it works

once you're set up, the ai agent guides the whole thing. you talk to it in plain english — no code, no jargon.

| command | what it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `$start` | brainstorm an idea and start building |
| `$help` | get unstuck when you're confused |
| `$debug` | fix problems automatically |
| `$deploy` | put your app on the internet with a shareable link |

you describe what you want, the agent builds it, and you see it live in your browser. one feature at a time, until you've got something real you can share.

## what's in the box

this repo comes pre-loaded with:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) — framework
- [HeroUI](https://heroui.com) — component library (buttons, cards, inputs, navbars, etc.)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) — styling
- [Framer Motion](https://motion.dev) — animations
- [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) — the ai agent that builds with you

you don't need to know what any of these are. the agent handles it all.
